## 1. Project Initiation (danish)

### i. Our Mobile App Detail

#### 1. title : BaristaPro :
   - The Gateway to Professional Coffee Training
#### 2. background of the problem : 
   - Finding reasonably priced, easily accessible, and excellent training programs to advance their talents is frequently a challenge for coffee lovers and aspiring baristas. Traditional training programs can be costly, location-specific, and have a narrow focus, which puts a barrier between professionals who are willing to share their knowledge and learners. Professional coffee trainers and baristas, meanwhile, do not have a specific platform to advertise their services, engage with students, and demonstrate their abilities.
#### 3. purpose or objective :
##### By developing an approachable, user-friendly platform that links aspiring baristas with coffee specialists, BaristaPro hopes to democratize professional coffee instruction. The app seeks to offer:

   - Users can learn barista techniques at their own pace with the help of extensive training modules.
   - A marketplace offering well chosen barista resources and gear.
   - networking possibilities in the coffee sector.
   - a route for students to obtain certificates and employment prospects.
#### 4. target user :
   ##### Primary: - Coffee enthusiasts, aspiring baristas, and home brewers who want to enhance their coffee-making skills.
   ##### Secondary: - Professional baristas, coffee trainers, and coffee shop owners seeking skilled staff or freelance baristas.
#### 5. preferred platform :
   - Native mobile app approach with iOS and Android compatibility to maximize accessibility.
#### 6. features and functionalities :
Key Features

   - Provide step-by-step courses covering coffee brewing techniques, latte art, equipment handling, and customer service.  
   - Include beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.

### ii. Why and How do you come up with this mobile app.

   #### Why:
Global interest in specialty coffee culture gave rise to the concept for BaristaPro. There is a definite need for professional and easily available coffee education given the growth of third-wave coffee businesses and home brewing hobbyists. Meeting this demand is challenging, though, due to a lack of training alternatives and the disconnect between learners and experts. BaristaPro has the ability to revolutionize the way coffee skills are taught and shared around the world by tackling these issues.

   #### How:
After studying the problems faced by trainers and coffee lovers, the features were created. The necessity for an organized forum where baristas could network and teach was brought to light by their feedback. Conversely, learners said that they wanted flexibility, affordability, and access to professional advice. The app was designed to close this gap by fusing industry tools, networking, and e-learning into a single, all-inclusive solution.

The necessity for coffee professionals to build reputation and make money off of their knowledge, as well as trends in related e-learning platforms, led to the inclusion of particular features like certifications and a resource marketplace. Selecting a mobile-first platform guarantees ease of use and accessibility, fitting in with the routines of contemporary professionals and learners.
